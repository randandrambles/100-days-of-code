### Day 1: April 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: A complain portal Android application.

**Thoughts:** Working on Android is new for me, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Today I started building an application. Completed it's front and backend, tried to connect the database with Firebase but failed.

**Today's Progress**: Firebase connected with complain portal

**Thoughts:** Today I started work to connect my complain portal with Firebase again.I choose Firebase because it don't require typical coding like MySQL. It was little bit challenging but in the end I succeeded.
