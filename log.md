# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: A complain application

**Thoughts:** Working on Android is new for me, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Today I started building an application. Completed it's front and backend, tried to connect the database with Firebase but failed.
